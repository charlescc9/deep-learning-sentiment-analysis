# deep-learning-sentiment-analysis

deep-learning-sentiment-analysis is an NLP sentiment analysis project. It aimed to correctly classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative. It uses gensim for document embedding and TensorFlow's API TFLearn for classification. 

## Data
deep-learning-sentiment-analysis uses Stanford's [Large Movie Review Dataset] (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). This dataset was designed for NLP sentiment analysis and published by [Maas et al] (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf). It consists of 12,500 positive train, negative train, positive test, and negative test reviews, along with 50,000 unlabeled reviews for unsupervised learning, for 100,000 total reviews.

## Academic Background
* [Maas et al] (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf)
* [Mikolov] (https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf)

## Software Dependencies
deep-learning-sentiment-analysis is written in Python 2.7 in a Jupyter notebook and uses several common software libraries, most notably gensim and TFLearn. In order to run it, you  must install the follow dependencies:
